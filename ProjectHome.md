Random bits and pieces of code intended for tools to extract files from certain digital recorders' hard drives, and allow replacement of these hard disks with larger models.

Note: It's possible that the current code project doesn't compile or fully work as intended, as some changes in the code since the last binaries were made available are not yet completed. Feel free to fix them, and send in your patches, so we can get a working library and working tools that make use of it.

Note 2: I do not know if the video format for recordings itself is readable, as I don't have access to a complete image of the hard disk containing a recording. The code here is intended as a reference starting point for whoever has time to work on it.

Source code is available under the Source tab.
